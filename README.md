# Mechanical-Fitting-Project
My project on fits consists of verifying the type of adjustment, the system (e.g., unitary), the maximum and minimum dimensions, as well as the tolerances for the bore and shaft, and the interference. In a special case, where the fit is preferential, we will calculate the preferential tolerances for the bore and shaft.
